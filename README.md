This repository contains the datasets used in our work entitled *Anycast on the Move: A Look at Mobile Anycast Performance*. In this paper, we describe our analysis for K-Root and F-Root DNS. The datasets additionally include experiments for Google DNS. 

- **WIFI.json** contains the anycast measurements carried out while the user was on a WiFi connection  
- **CELL.json** contains the anycast measurements carried out while the user was on a cellular connection

Each line corresponds to one experiment. 

In each experiment, for each of the 3 DNS services, clients launched ping and traceroute measurements towards the DNS serverâ€™s anycast address, as well as towards five chosen unicast addresses of the analyzed DNS service determined to be the geographically closest to the client.
